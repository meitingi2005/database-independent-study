# database-independent-study
### Purpose
In the last unit of Software Engineering Class, I was asked to conduct an independent study on any topics I want. The independent study will last for 9 weeks and I will submit an entry each week to record what I have learned in that week. Since I just finished the Ruby unit, I decided to continue learning something related to Ruby, which is databases.
